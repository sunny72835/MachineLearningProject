Course project Machine Learning class
A simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data 
containing 29623 SNPs (total features). Amongst all SNPs are 15 causal 
ones which means they and neighboring ones discriminate between case and 
controls while remainder are noise.

Training data: 8000 rows
Test data: 2000 rows
Objective: Reduce dataset by feature selection, learn a model and predict test data after applying same feature selection as training data.
